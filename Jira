🔹 Jira Summary

Kubernetes Environment Upgrade, ESB Pod Deployment, Monitoring Setup & ArgoCD Configuration

⸻

🔹 Jira Description (Task Assigned to Me)

This task involves upgrading the existing Kubernetes environment to the latest version and ensuring that all ESB service pods are deployed and functioning correctly after the upgrade.

As part of this activity, I am responsible for setting up a complete monitoring stack using Prometheus, Node Exporter, and kube-state-metrics to ensure node health, pod performance, and cluster visibility.
Additionally, I need to configure ArgoCD to enable automated and consistent deployments across the environment.

The implementation of HAProxy for load balancing will also be planned and initiated within this week as part of the overall cluster improvement and stability roadmap.
