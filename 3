Great — since your **Kubernetes master node is 10.57.10.129**, and you are running `kubectl proxy` **on that server**, you **cannot** access `http://localhost:8001` from your laptop.
It only listens on **127.0.0.1 inside the server**, not on your laptop.

So you must use **port-forwarding** to access the Dashboard UI.

Below is the **correct and easiest method** for your setup.

---

# ✅ **BEST METHOD: Port-forward directly to the Dashboard service**

Run this on your master node (10.57.10.129):

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n kubernetes-dashboard svc/kubernetes-dashboard 8443:443
```

You will see:

```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8443 -> 8443
```

Now **on your laptop**, open this URL:

```
https://10.57.10.129:8443
```

👉 **It MUST be https, not http**
👉 Your browser will show a certificate warning → Click **Proceed / Continue**.

# 🔐 **Login to Dashboard**

If you have not created a user:

Create admin-user:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/docs/user/access-control/creating-sample-user.yaml
```

Get token:

```bash
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create token admin-user
```

Copy & paste the token into the Dashboard login screen.

# 🎉 **After login, you will see Pod metrics UI**

On left side:

✔ **Cluster → Nodes** → CPU/Memory graphs
✔ **Workloads → Pods** → per-pod CPU/Memory (from metrics-server)

Since your metrics-server is running correctly, metrics will display.
