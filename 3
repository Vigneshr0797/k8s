From your output, the cluster is up, but **no CNI plugin is properly running**, which explains:

* `calico-node` is in `Init:CrashLoopBackOff`
* `calico-kube-controllers` is `Pending`
* `coredns` pods are `Pending`
* Node shows `NotReady` with `NetworkPluginNotReady`

This is **classic Kubernetes bootstrap failure due to missing or broken CNI**. Without a working CNI:

* Pods cannot get an IP.
* CoreDNS cannot schedule.
* Node stays `NotReady`.

### **Steps to fix this**

Since you want a **fresh setup**, here’s what to do to clean Calico/CNI and restart properly:

---

#### **1. Remove old CNI and Calico remnants**

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/cni/net.d
sudo rm -rf /opt/cni/bin
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cni/
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/calico
sudo rm -rf /var/run/calico
sudo rm -rf /var/run/nodeagent
```

---

#### **2. Reset kubeadm cluster (if needed)**

> Only do this if you want to restart fully from scratch.

```bash
sudo kubeadm reset -f
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

---

#### **3. Reapply Calico CNI**

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.29.2/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.29.2/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
```

> Make sure `kubectl get pods -n kube-system` shows all Calico pods starting and eventually `Running`.

---

#### **4. Wait for node to become Ready**

```bash
kubectl get nodes -w
```

Node should switch from `NotReady` → `Ready`.

---

#### **5. Check CoreDNS**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl describe pod <coredns-pod> -n kube-system
```

Once CNI works, CoreDNS will schedule and become `Running`.

---

💡 **Key point:**
Your previous issue with `Init:Error` on calico-node is due to:

* CNI binaries missing (`/opt/cni/bin` empty)
* Possibly leftover network config files
* Calico containers cannot initialize IPAM/network.

Cleaning `/etc/cni/net.d`, `/opt/cni/bin`, `/var/lib/calico`, then reapplying Calico fixes this in most cases.

If you want, I can give you a **full ready-to-run sequence** to completely clean Kubernetes, containerd, and CNI/Calico and **reinitialize a working single-node cluster** from scratch.

Do you want me to do that?
