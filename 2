I understand that you want to completely remove Kubernetes, its container runtime (`containerd`), CNI plugins, Calico, and related files from your system. This is essentially a **full Kubernetes cleanup** on your node. Be **very careful**, as this will completely remove all Kubernetes configurations, containers, and networking setups.

Here’s a step-by-step approach:

---

### **1. Stop Kubernetes services**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop kubelet
sudo systemctl stop containerd
sudo systemctl stop kube-proxy
```

If you have Docker installed and used:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker
```

---

### **2. Remove Kubernetes binaries**

```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/kubeadm /usr/bin/kubectl /usr/bin/kubelet /usr/bin/kube-proxy
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
sudo rm -rf /etc/kubernetes/
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/kubelet
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/etcd
```

---

### **3. Remove containerd**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop containerd
sudo rm -rf /etc/containerd
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/containerd
sudo rm -rf /run/containerd
sudo dnf remove -y containerd
```

Check for running containerd processes:

```bash
ps aux | grep containerd
```

Kill any remaining processes if needed:

```bash
sudo pkill containerd
```

---

### **4. Remove CNI plugins**

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/cni/net.d
sudo rm -rf /opt/cni/bin
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cni/
```

---

### **5. Remove Calico**

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/calico
sudo rm -rf /var/run/calico
sudo rm -rf /etc/calico
```

If Calico pods are still running:

```bash
kubectl delete ns kube-system --force --grace-period=0
```

> Note: This is destructive and will delete all system pods.

---

### **6. Remove network interfaces and overlays**

Check for leftover interfaces:

```bash
ip link show
```

Remove Calico interfaces (they usually start with `cali`):

```bash
sudo ip link delete caliXXXX
```

Unload overlay kernel module if needed:

```bash
sudo modprobe -r overlay
```

---

### **7. Remove remaining Kubernetes configs and logs**

```bash
sudo rm -rf ~/.kube
sudo rm -rf /var/log/pods
sudo rm -rf /var/log/containers
sudo rm -rf /var/run/kubernetes
```

---

### **8. Optional: reboot**

After removing everything:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

✅ After this, your node will be completely clean, and you can reinstall Kubernetes and containerd from scratch.

---

If you want, I can give you a **single shell script** that does **everything safely in the correct order** to completely wipe Kubernetes + containerd + CNI + Calico from your system.

Do you want me to do that?
