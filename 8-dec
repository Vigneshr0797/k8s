EPIC Status Change: Mark EPIC Tasks & Sub-Tasks as “Not Required”

✅ Summary (for EPIC or Task)

Status Update: Tasks and Sub-Tasks Marked as Not Required

✅ Description

The tasks and their associated sub-tasks under this Epic have been reviewed in detail.
Based on the current project scope, updated requirements, and discussions with the functional team, these items are no longer required for further development or testing activities.

Key points:
	•	Requirements were revisited with stakeholders.
	•	Identified tasks/sub-tasks do not contribute to the finalized functional scope.
	•	No further implementation effort is needed.
	•	All dependent or related work items have been cross-checked to avoid impact on other deliverables.

Therefore, the status of the tasks and their sub-tasks has been updated to “Not Required” and the Epic reflects this change appropriately.

✅ Worklog Comment

Reviewed the tasks and sub-tasks as part of scope realignment. After confirming with stakeholders, marked the items as Not Required since the functionality is no longer part of the delivered scope. Updated the Epic and ensured no downstream dependencies are impacted.

Kubernetes Dashboard Implementation

✅ Summary

Kubernetes Dashboard Implementation and Access Configuration

✅ Description

The Kubernetes Dashboard has been successfully implemented in the SIT environment to provide a visual and user-friendly interface for managing cluster resources.
The setup includes dashboard deployment, RBAC configuration, creation of permanent admin and user access tokens, and secure access provisioning using service accounts.

Implementation Activities:
	1.	Deployed Kubernetes Dashboard using the recommended upstream manifests.
	2.	Configured kubernetes-dashboard namespace and ServiceAccount.
	3.	Implemented RBAC rules for both Admin (cluster-admin) and Read-Only User access.
	4.	Generated non-expiring ServiceAccount tokens for dashboard login.
	5.	Verified access using kubeconfig and token-based authentication.
	6.	Tested UI visibility for pods, deployments, namespaces, events, logs, metrics, and Health checks.
	7.	Ensured secure HTTPS access through NodePort / Ingress as required.
	8.	Validated functionality with Metrics Server integration.

Dashboard is now fully functional and available for usage by DevOps and development teams.
