You found the **exact root cause**:

### 🚨 Node has this taint:

```
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoSchedule
```

and the **Ready** condition is:

```
Ready: False
Reason: container runtime network not ready
Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
```

📌 **This means:**
Your master node is **NotReady** because **Calico CNI did not come up**, and because the node is NotReady, Kubernetes automatically applied the taint:

```
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoSchedule
```

Because of that taint, **CoreDNS and Calico cannot schedule**, and you have a deadlock:

---

# ❗ DEADLOCK SITUATION

### 1. Calico cannot start → CNI not initialized

### 2. Node becomes NotReady

### 3. Node gets taint: `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoSchedule`

### 4. As long as Calico cannot start, node stays NotReady

### 5. CoreDNS and Calico cannot schedule due to the taint

This is a classic bootstrap issue.

---

# ✅ FIX THE ISSUE STEP BY STEP

We must do **two fixes**:

---

# ✅ STEP 1 — Remove the taint temporarily

This will allow Calico and CoreDNS to schedule even if the node is NotReady.

Run:

```
kubectl taint nodes eqvlwso2apsit15-master1 node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoSchedule-
```

This removes the "NotReady" taint.

After running this, run:

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

You should see Calico and CoreDNS starting to schedule.

---

# ❗ STEP 2 — Fix the real root cause: Calico CNI Init:Error

Your pod showed this:

```
calico-node Init:Error
cni plugin not initialized
```

That means **Calico cannot load CNI binaries**.

This is because your container runtime installation was broken earlier:

```
dial unix /var/run/containerd/containerd.sock: no such file or directory
```

### You likely installed Containerd manually OR Docker before, and paths are wrong.

### Let's verify containerd:

Run:

```
systemctl status containerd
```

If it's not running, start it:

```
systemctl start containerd
systemctl enable containerd
```

Also check:

```
ls -l /var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

If this file does Not Exist → kubelet cannot talk to containerd → CNI will never start → Node will stay NotReady.

---

# 🔧 STEP 3 — Verify your kubelet config

Run:

```
cat /var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env
```

Look for:

```
--container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

or

```
--container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

Make sure the actual socket exists at the same path.

---

# 🔧 STEP 4 — Check CNI files

Run:

```
ls /etc/cni/net.d/
```

You should see something like:

```
10-calico.conflist
```

If the folder is empty → Calico never installed.

Run:

```
kubectl logs -n kube-system calico-node-wbst5 -c install-cni
```

Share the log if error.

---

# EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX

Once containerd is running + CNI binaries installed, you’ll see:

```
Ready: True
```

and all kube-system pods will become Running.

---

# 🧨 VERY IMPORTANT

Your entire issue is caused by:

* containerd not running / not installed properly
* CNI (Calico) init failing
* node NotReady
* taint blocking scheduling

Fixing these will restore the cluster.

---

# ✔️ Now do this and share output:

### 1. Remove taint:

```
kubectl taint nodes eqvlwso2apsit15-master1 node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoSchedule-
```

### 2. Check containerd:

```
systemctl status containerd
```

### 3. Check containerd socket:

```
ls -l /var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

### 4. Check CNI:

```
ls /etc/cni/net.d/
```

Send the outputs — then I will guide you precisely.
